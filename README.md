## 1.0 - IT CONCEPTS AND TERMINOLOGY
- Computer Literacy: the ability to use computers and related technology efficiently, including understanding how they work and operate.<br>
- Computer systems work similarly hence knowing one system helps learn another.<br>
- Computing Process: Input, Processing, Output, Storage (same for every device)<br>
- Input/Output devices enable communication with a computer enhancing capabilities of computers.<br>
- Processing components handle commands.<br>
- Storage devices save data and programs for later use.<br>
- General-purpose computing devices, e.g., PCs, tablets, laptops, smartphones are adaptable, increasing their functionality and enables them to be more useful.<br>
- Users can add apps to enable more functionality.<br>
- Local Area Network (LAN): a basic computer network that connects devices within a limited area via switch. Local and usually small. Much faster. Server uses LAN to provide network.<br>
- LAN Charateristics: Small, local, connected groups of devices. e.g.: P2P, small offices.<br>
- Wide Area Network (WAN): Routers connect one or more LANs into a WAN.<br>
- WAN Characteristics: Devices on different networks connect. e.g.: A company's global offices connecting to each other.<br>
- Internet: LAN combined with WAN together.<br>
- LANs, WANs, and the Internet are paths to reach remotely-accessed computer systems.<br>
- Remotely-Accessed Computer Systems: allow users to access a computer from a distance, either for work or other purposes enhancing local capabilities.<br>

## 1.1 - NOTATIONAL SYSTEM
- Four major number systems; decimal system, binary system, hexadecimal system, and octal system. <br>
- Decimal System (Base-10)<br>
      &emsp;- Common number system that uses 10 digits; 0 ~ 9<br>
      &emsp;- Place value based on powers of 10 and its digit's value is determined by its position.<br>
      &emsp;- Intuitive for humans however, computers prefer binary system for efficiency.<br>
- Binary System (Base-2)<br>
      &emsp;- Uses only two digits; 0 and 1<br>
      &emsp;- Each binary place value represents a power of 2.<br>
      &emsp;- Importance: computers use binary because hardware systems operate in two states: on (1) and off (0). It efficiently represents these electrical states, making it ideal for computing.<br>
- Hexadecimal System (Base-16)<br>
      &emsp;- Uses 16 symbols; digits 0 ~ 9, letters A ~ F<br>
      &emsp;- Efficient in computing because it represents large binary numbers. 1 hecadecimal digit = 4 binaru digits (bits).<br>
      &emsp;- Commonly used to represent memory addresses because it is more compact than binary and provides a straightforward mapping to binary values, making it easier for humans to read and understand. <br>
- Octal System (Base-8)<br>
      &emsp;- Uses digits 0 ~ 7<br>
      &emsp;- Less common todat but used in early computing alongside binary and hexadecimal.<br>
      &emsp;- Each value represents a power of 8.<br>
      &emsp;- Why it is used: Easier to convert binary numbers (groups of 3 binary digits = 1 octal digit). Common in earlier systems with 12-but, 24-bit, or 36-bit architecture. It also improved readability and efficiency in specific computing environments.<br>

## 1.2 - UNITS OF MEASURE
- Units of measure in computing: Bit & Byte (fundamental building blocks of data), Larger Units, Data Transfer Rates, Hertz, RPM, Watts.<br>
- Bit (binary digit)<br>
      &emsp;- Smallest unit of data in computing.<br>
      &emsp;- Can be either a 0 or a 1<br>
      &emsp;- Forms the foundation for all digital data.<br>
      &emsp;- Data transfer is measure in bits per second (bps).<br>
- Byte<br>
      &emsp;- Consists of 8 bits.<br>
      &emsp;- Typically represents a single character (e.g.: letter "A").<br>
      &emsp;- Most data we interact with is measured in bytes.<br>
      &emsp;- Data storage is measured in bytes.<br>
- Kilobyte (KB)<br>
      &emsp;- Equals 1,024 bytes (commonly rounded to 1K bytes for simplicity).<br>
- Megabyte (MB)<br>
      &emsp;- Equals 1,024 KB or approximately 1 million bytes.<br>
- Gigabyte (GB)<br>
      &emsp;- Equals 1,024 MB or approximately 1 billion bytes.<br>
- Terabyte (TB)<br>
      &emsp;- Equals 1,024 GB or approximately 1 trillion bytes.<br>
- Petabyte (PB)<br>
      &emsp;- Equals 1,024 TB or approximately 1 quadrillion bytes and often used by data centers and cloud storage providers.<br>
- Data Transfer Units<br>
      &emsp;- Bits per second (bps) is the smallest unit of measuring data transfer speed.<br>
      &emsp;- Kilobits per second (Kbps). <br>
      &emsp; &emsp;- 1Kbps = 1,000 bits per second.<br>
      &emsp; &emsp;- Commonly dial-up internet connections. <br>
      &emsp;- Megabits per second (Mbps).<br>
      &emsp; &emsp;- 1Mbps = 1,000 Kbps or 1 million bits per second.<br>
      &emsp; &emsp;- Typical for broadband internet speeds. <br>
      &emsp; &emsp;- 1 byte = 8 bits, so 100 Mbps = 12.5 MBps (megabytes per second) <br>
      &emsp;- Gigabits per second (Gbps).<br>
      &emsp; &emsp;- 1Gbps = 1,000 Mbps or 1 billion bits per second.<br>
      &emsp; &emsp;- Used in high-speed networks, e.g. fiber optic connections. <br>
      &emsp;- Terabytes per second (TBps)<br>
      &emsp; &emsp;- 1TBps = 8Tbps (terabits per second) or 1,000 Gbps.<br>
      &emsp; &emsp;- Found in supercomputing and data center environments for massive data transfer. <br>
- Hertz (Hz) : measuring frequency and speed. <br>
      &emsp;- Measures frequency in cycles per second. <br>
      &emsp;- In computing, it refers to the clock speed or how fast a CPU processes instructions. <br>
      &emsp;- 1 Hz = one cycle/operation per second. (e.g., a CPU performing 1 operation per second is very slow).<br>
      &emsp;&emsp;- Kilohertz (kHz) = 1,000 hertz.<br>
      &emsp;&emsp;- Megahertz (MHz) = 1 million hertz.<br>
      &emsp;&emsp;- Gigahertz (GHz) = 1 billion hertz.<br>
      &emsp;- Modern CPU typically measured in GHz which indicates billions of operations per second.<br>
      &emsp;- Higher clock speeds enable processors to perform more operations per second, generally improving performance. <br>
- Storage Speed: RPM for Hard Drives.<br>
      &emsp;- Revolutions per Minute (RPM) measures how fast the platters inside a HDD spin.<br>
      &emsp;- It directly impacts read/write performance.<br>
      &emsp;- Higher RPM = faster data access. <br>
      &emsp;- 5,400 RPM is the standard for low-power and budget HDDs, slower performance while 7,200 RPM is common in mainstream HDDs, offers faster data transfer. <br>
      &emsp;- SDDs do not use RPM because they do not have moving parts. It is much faster than HDDs in terms of read/write speed due to falsh memory technology.<br>
- Power Units: Watts (W).<br>
      &emsp;- Measures the rate of energy transfer in computing devices. <br>
      &emsp;- It describes how much power a device consumes during operation.<br>
      &emsp;- Knowing wattage is crucial for selecting appropriate power supplies in computer systems as well as helping to understand and manage energy efficiency.<br>

- It matters which port you connect the USB to because the speed is different.<br>
- CD's: 700MB, DVD: 4.7 or 8.5GB, Blue-Ray: 50GB.<br>
- Modern systems blend fast RAM with larger SSD/HDD for efficient performance.<br>
- Advancement: Storage devices are becoming faster, more compact, and efficient.<br>

## 5.0 - UNDERSTANDING OPERATING SYSTEMS
- Every computing device has an operating system (OS), e.g., windows, macOS, Chrome OS, Linux, iOS, Androids.<br>
- OS provides user interface (a way to interact with the OS), coordination among hardware, monitors health and way to store and retrieve data.<br>
- HWMonitor: help you keep tabs on various hardware parameters in your computer system.<br>
- Most OS have similar user interfaces, but use different names, e.g., Windows has Start Screen and taskbar; macOS has the Dock; Windows uses File Explore, macOS uses Finder.<br>
- Boot camp is used for dual-boot machine but can only be downloaded on mac.<br>
- Without an OS, the computing device can't run any software or other programs.<br>
- Firefox is a third-party browser.<br>
- System applet: where you can find what version of Windows is running on a computer.<br>
- Desktop: where files, folders and shortcuts to files and programs can be seen.<br>
- Devices and printers: where you can see which printers are available for use, and documents is where files you created can be stored.<br>

## 6.0 - SETTING UP AND CONFIGURING A PC
- For overall comfort, the ideal temperature is 72 Fahrenheit and 50% humidity.<br>
- Monitor should be 16-24 inches away from the user.<br>
- The top of the monitor should be lined up with your eye level.<br>
- Make sure your wrists aren't bend awkwardly.<br>
- Set chair height so legs bend at 90 degrees.<br>
- Setup starts with hardware connectivity.<br>
- Personalization: tells us where you live for the time zone. <br>
- Window Defender is automatically installed for security purposes.<br>
- Power strip:  a block of electrical sockets that attaches to the end of a flexible cable (typically with a mains plug on the other end), allowing multiple electrical devices to be powered from a single electrical socket.<br>
- Surge protector: protect electronic equipment from unwanted power surges or "spikes."<br>
- Uninterruptable Power Supply: device that keeps electronics powered on when there is a power failure. A UPS typically has a charged battery that supplies power when there is a power outage.<br>
- Brown Out: a reduction in or restriction on the availability of electrical power in a particular area.<br>
- Black Out: a failure of electrical power supply.<br>
- It is important to have the OS up-to-date to make sure any security holes have been filled and any previous issues (bugs) have been fixed. <br>

## 7.0 - SETTING UP AND CONFIGURING A MOBILE DEVICE
- Accept the EULA.<br>
- End-User License Agreement (EULA) explains what you can or cannot do on a device or with a piece of software and must be agreed to in order to use the device or software.<br>
- Connect to the Internet and update the device's firmware and OS.<br>
- Customize device by adding e-mail and apps.<br>
- Storage: capacity to store files, whatever you bought, you get it with Apple but with Android you can add more because it comes with a SD card.<br>
- Data Usage: how much info is flowing from the cell phone company to your device.<br>
- What you get from LG can be different from what you can get from Samsung because every company who uses Android can customize the OS accordingly.<br>
- Apple devices are in their own ecosystem which provides seamless interataction between its devices.<br>
- Reasons why apps crash: the app is poorly written, the app was written with a specific Android in mind.<br>
- How to solve: wait for a patch, check for the updated versions.<br>
- Synchronize all the apps in the device to the laptop.<br>
- Resolution: the pixels that make up the screen. the finer the pixels, the higher the resolution and vice versa.<br>

## 8.0 - MANAGING FILES
- You can create, copy, paste, move, cut, delete, and permanently delete files.<br>
- When you drag and drop between two different drives, it becomes a copy action.<br>
- Backups data manually or use a program to do it for you.<br>
- Back up to locally attached storage, network attached storage (NAS) and cloud storage.<br>
- Always verify backups.<br>
- Run regularly scheduled backups through default or 3rd party tools.<br>
- Make sure to do backups once a week or at least once a month.<br>
- Indexing: keep tracks of all the files in system not just by date or author but also by contents of the files.<br>
- Hotkeys: combination you can use on the keyboard both in the OS and apps to reduce time consuming by using the mouse.<br>

## 9.0 - USING AND MANAGING APPLICATION SOFTWARE
- Programming: creating an apps to enable users to do stuff.<br>
- Life cycles of application: Install, update, uninstall.<br>
- Installation: insert an optical disk or download the apps from the Internet.<br>
- User Account Control: security feature in Windows to stop malicious software from installing without permission.<br>
- Security Patches: software updates that fix vulnerabilities in a program or operating system to prevent cybercriminals from exploiting them.<br>
- Check for Updates: from the application.<br>
- Uninstall: (Windows) control panels > programs and features.<br>
- File Association: a link between a file type and the application that opens it.<br>
- File Extension: extension that relates with the associate program. e.g.: .docx, .xlsx, .pptx, .eml, .jpg or .jpe, .tif or .png, .zip, .exe (executable files), .mp4 or .avi or .mpg<br>
- Compression Files: squish a big file to a smaller file.<br>
- Well known office productivity applications: Microsoft Office 365, GoogleSuite, OpenOffice<br>
- OneDrive enables sharing and real-time document editing in an online workspace.<br>
- Open source: programmer has created and shared it for free use, but not commercially use. We can change and implement the code if we share it.<br>
- Open source may not have the newest feature and not being updated frequently.<br>
- Remote Access Software: allows for remote access to help through the troubleshooting steps when you are having an issue that you cannot solve. e.g.: AnyDesk, Remote Desktop, Connectwise<br>
- Updating an application as frequent as possible is a must. Microsoft makes update every first Tuesday of the month.<br>
- Browsers: to allow browsing the internet. Each browser generally have default search engine. You can change your preferred search engine. e.g.: Safari -> Google , Chrome -> Google, Brave -> Brave<br>
- Profile Synchronization: when you can go to any device and log in and see your themes, bookmarks, items, and features. It creates a seamless and wonderful user experience from one device to another.<br>
- Extension: embedded application to enhance functionality of the browsers. Extension comes in all size and shape depending on the feature you are looking for, there probably is an extension for it.<br>
- Clearing cache or temporary memory is crucial. Cache stores cookie files that store interactions with different websites, settings, and preffered features. Although it provides enhance user experience, attacker can use it to be able to gather information. Browser history should be cleared out periodically.<br>
- Nothing is completely private but we can increase privacy by using private browser like incognito window.<br>
- Pop-up Blocker: stops potentially annoying or even potentially malicious pop-up from taking your internet browsing experience. It is enabled by default.<br>
- Artifical Intelligence: can analyse data, make suggestions, create contents, solve problems, and make decisions. It is a combination of different components of Computer Science, Mathematics, Cognitive Science as well as other fields.<br>
- Machine Learning: ability of the machine to learn and grow. Made up of three components: representation, evaluation, and optimization.<br>
- Natural Language Processing: ability to understand human language. Consists of understanding, processing, and communication.<br>
- AI Chatbot: a conversational agent. Does not design to do complex features and functions. Can ony handle simple tasks that is mostly pre-design.<br>
- AI Virtual Assistants: can complete more comprehensive assistance and complex activities. Can carry more "real" conversations. e.g.: Siri, Google Assistant.<br>
- Generative AI: an AI-created content. e.g.: ChatGPT, Bard. It can really increase the speed and efficiency.<br>
- AI-Generated Code: a programming that is written in different programming language.<br>
- AI-Generated Content: using natural language processing, machine learning, and deep learning.<br>
- Deep Learning: a deeper lever of machine learning.<br>

## 10.0 - CONFIGURING NETWORK AND INTERNET CONNECTIVITY
- Networking is all about communciating.<br>
- Computing devices can comminucate across great distances if they have the correct information. Proper routing of the data to the right device is important.<br>
- How to accomplish this:<br>
      &emsp;1) Media Access Control (MAC) Address: a 12 digit hexadecimal number assign by the manifacturer that is unique to the network interface of the device. Can be checked through ipconfig /all command -> Physical Address<br>
      &emsp;2) Internet Protocol (IP) Address: like a phone number of the device. Made of 4 sets of numbers separated by dots. Private IP is IP address allocated to the local network.<br>
      &emsp;3) Ports. There is 66,535 ports altogether. Ports 0-1,023 are assigned to specific services. Ports 1,024-65,535 are ephemeral ports with various uses; can be used for many different things and they are very flexible and versatile. <br>
      &emsp;4) Network Interface Card (NIC): the physical connection point between a computer and a network.<br>
      &emsp;5) Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Networks: A home network. A very specific type of LAN, where each devices equals and share resources. Smaller and does not requires a server.<br>
      &emsp;6) Client-Server Model: devices access shared resources within the same LAN. e.g.: Shared office printer.<br>
- Without the RJ45 cable, there is no networking.<br>
- RJ45 standards: Category (cat) 5, 6, and 7.<br>
- The only visible difference is the marking ont he casing.<br>
- Cat 6 and 7 are generally faster and more resistant to interference and can even support two-way communication, while cat 5 is slower and can only support one-way communication.<br>
- Things use for cabling: Cable crimpers, RJ45 ends, and cable testers.<br>
- Main devices that we need to create networks:<br>
      &emsp;1) Modulator/Demodulator: converts from analog to digital and digital to analog. Allows computer to connect to the internet.<br>
      &emsp;2) Switch: a device that connects multiple devices in the network. e.g.: printers, computers, servers on the LANs.<br>
      &emsp;3) Firewalls: it protects from the bad of internets. Can be customised to open and close specific ports, allowing or disallowing specific types of network traffics, in and out of the network. It uses the access control lists to define what traffic is allowed in and out of the network.<br>
      &emsp;4) Access Point: connecting Wi-Fi to the wired network.<br>
- Three different internet access options:<br>
      &emsp;1) Wired: where you plugged in the device into the wall by RJ45.<br>
      &emsp;2) Wireless: Wi-Fi.<br>
      &emsp;3) Cellular: using cellular telephone network.<br>
- Reasons to determine the best home-network: mobility, availability, reliability, throughput, connection delay, latency, number of concurrent connections, and level of security.<br>
- Internet Access Considerations:<br>
      &emsp;1) Mobility: how far you can travel and still can access the network resources.<br>
      &emsp;2) Availability: Probability that a system will be functional.<br>
      &emsp;3) Reliability: Quality of data received and the error checking and correcting capabilities of the technology.<br>
      &emsp;4) Throughput: data transfer rate. e.g.: How quickly does your email download.<br>
      &emsp;5) Latency: connection delay between the reiuqest and the response to the request.<br>
      &emsp;6) Number of Concurrect Connections: number of the simultaneous users who can connect to the internet.<br>
      &emsp;7) Level of Security: How resistant is this connection to some sort of internet base attack.<br>
- Wired always beats wireless and cellular except mobility. <br>
- Internet Connectors:<br>
      &emsp;- RJ45: standard ethernet connector.<br>
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31c9f324-0228-407f-9323-ff6b43890382)<br>
      &emsp;- Small Form-Factor Pluggable (SFP): High-speed ethernet connector utilizes fiber optic cabling.<br>
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c037ce0f-f962-4d96-8475-1cc781ed7f3a)<br>
- Wired networks do not worry about signal loss or cloud cover. The quality of the data received makes it the most reliable. Data-speed is up to 10GB per sec. Offers the lowest latency, they do not wait for the signal to cross the air, they can be interfered easily. Offers great security as long as you do not let a bad guy plug to the network. <br>
- Wireless or Wi-Fi generally comes second. The freedom to roam is extremely nice.<br>
- Most households are going wireless because it is less expensive, easier to install, and supports all of their computing devices.<br>
- 802.11 is a wireless standard. (Current standard is 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6)).<br>
- Older standards are more flexible with older devices.<br>
- 6GHz offers the fastest speed but not all devices are compatible with it. 2.4 GHz and 5GHz offer slower connection but still pretty standard. If the device cannot connects to the 6GHz or 5GHz, it can downstep to the 2.4GHz.<br>
- Wi-Fi Channels can overlap and lead to interference or slow internet. By default it is probably fine but you need to consider your environment, if the area is is congested, narrow the channel.<br>
- 6GHz Wi-Fi requires the highest-level security: Wireless Protected Access 3 (WPA3). 2.4 and 5GHz Wi-Fi allow for the lower-security WPA and WPA2. 6GHz does not support WPA2.<br>
- Selecting the highest level of security ensures no one is piggybacking your Wi-Fi for free.<br>
- How to connect to printers: Control panels -> Hardware and Sound -> Devices and Printers -> Select the printer you want to share -> Properties -> Sharing<br>
- Once the printer is shared, it is available to everyone on the network.<br>

## 11.0 - NETWORK SECURITY CONCEPTS
- Successful local computer security means protecting access to your stuff from the bad guy. e.g.: piggybacking your Wi-Fi without us knowing.<br>
- Phishing:
- Unauthorized Access: lock your computer when you walk away from it even for a short period of time. Make sure your account is password-protected.<br>
- Shoulder Surfing: always make sure there is no stranger's shoulders surfing behind you.<br>
- Dumpster Diving: Make sure to shred any trash that you do not want prying eyes to see.<br>
- Encryption: an important security concept when connecting with the world throughtout technology.<br>
- User Data Encryption:<br>
      &emsp;1) Plaintext: easily observe letters and symbols that most peorple can read and understand. Not secure and nothing is hidden.<br>
      &emsp;2) Cyphertext: an encryption in its most basic form. An encryption algorithm is being applied to turn plaintext to cyphertext.<br>
- We need to know what encryption algorithm and what key were used to encrypt the message.<br>
- Data at Rest: not actively being used.<br>
- File-Level Encryption: data that is stored in files or folders in an ecrypted state.<br>
- Disk-Level Encryption: data that is encrypted at a disk-level; which means the entire drive is encrypted rather than just some of the files.<br>
- Mobile Device Encryption: can encrypt data the same way as the computer. Can only disable the encryption oif factory resets it.<br>
- Data in Transit: actively being used. Data is moving from one place to another in encrypted form. e.g.: sending an email, uploading it on cloud.<br>
- Virtual Private Network (VPN): encrypted all data in transit when enabled. It basically creates a tunnel that ensures protection measures are in place all the time. Sacrifices a little bit of speed.<br>
- Data in Use: information that is being actively processed, accessed, or modified by users, devices, or applications. <br>
- AAA Framework: Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting. It is a security framework that controls access to the computer's resources, enforces policies, and audits the users.<br>
      &emsp;1) Authentication: a cybersecurity process that verifies user identity before granting access.<br>
      &emsp;&emsp;- Types of Authentication: something that you have (e.g.: a key card), Something that you know (e.g.: password), something you are (e.g.: biometrics)<br>
      &emsp;&emsp;- Non-Repudiation: cannot deny involvement in the transaction. For example, it is highly likely that it is you. <br>
      &emsp;2) Authorization: Are you allowed access? You have permission / privileges to be there. There are different ways to set priviliges. <br>
      &emsp;&emsp;- Single Factor: you only need one item to authenticate. e.g.: one password, one biometric scan.<br>
      &emsp;&emsp;- Multifactor: two or multiple different ways which increase the likelihood that it is you. e.g.: a key card then the fingerprint.<br>
      &emsp;&emsp;- Single Sign On: allows you to access multiple apps with one set of credentials. e.g.: Google Account.<br>
      &emsp;3) Accounting: ability to track and record user activity. e.g.: logs, location tracking, browser history. <br>
- Least Privilege: users and programs should only have acccess to the minimum amount of resources necessary.<br>
- Administrator is more trusted.<br>
- Logs tell whoever wants to know the who, what, when, and why.<br>

## 12.0 - BEHAVIORAL SECURITY
- Security Awareness<br>
      &emsp;1) Patching / Updating Software.<br>
      &emsp;&emsp;- Fixes security flaws.<br>
      &emsp;&emsp;- Helps block vulnerabilities from attackers.<br>
      &emsp;&emsp;- Some applications will update automatically, some you have to manually tell them to update.<br>
      &emsp;&emsp;- Be sure to update your operating system and web browsers. Always install updates as soon as it is available.<br>
      &emsp;2) Physical Security<br>
      &emsp;&emsp;- Ensures your devices are secure. e.g.: cable locks, USB locks (can prevent unauthorised access to your data or malware infections through rogue USB devices).<br>
- Device Best Practices<br>
      &emsp;1) Licensing: they are several types of software licenses.<br>
      &emsp;&emsp;- Open source software gives users freedom to modify and share meanwhile proprietary softwarew comes with restrictions.<br>
      &emsp;&emsp;- Subscription-based gives you access as long as you pay meanwhile One-Time Purchases (perpetual license) means you own the software indefinitely so you have to make sure you track your product keys and serial numbers. They are specific to the product itself and you need it for reinstallation or transfers. <br>
      &emsp;2) Software Downloads:<br>
      &emsp;&emsp;- Make sure it is from legitimate stores like Google Play or Apple App Store or direct manufacturer / Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) websites.<br>
      &emsp;&emsp;- Avoid third-party websites as it can expose your system to malicious files.<br>
      &emsp;&emsp;- Research any unknown sources to make sure it is trustworthy.<br>
- Software Piracy: unauthorised copying, distribution, or use of software. It is often contains malware which can compromised your systems, steal your personal data. It usually leaves you with no support, updates, or patches putting your securiy at risk.<br>
- Safe Web Browsing: Website security certificate. You know it is a legit website if there is a padlock symbol at the right of the address bar on top of the browser. If it is invalid, you might get a warning and do not enter any sensitive information as the site is vulnerable to attacks.<br>
- Privacy Considerations:<br>
      &emsp;1) Social Networking Sites: be cautious about sharing too much personal information. Adjusts privacy setting to limit who can see your posts. <br>
      &emsp;2) E-Mail: Phishing scams, where attackers are trying to hook you into downloading malware or giving them your persoinal information. Never click on links or download attachments from unknown senders. <br>
      &emsp;3) File Sharing: riksy if you do not know the source.<br>
      &emsp;4) Instant Messaging: avoid sharing sensitive or personally identifiable information. e.g: full name, address.<br>
- Govenrment Regulations: design to protect privacy and security.<br>
      &emsp;1) General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR): applies to European Union, focuses on protecting personal data and privacy. It ensures company is transparent about how the collect, use, and store personal data.<br>
      &emsp;2) Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX): US law regulates financial practices and reporting. Includes provision to protect sensitive financial data.<br>
      &emsp;3) Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS): global standard helps ensure secure processing of credit card information. e.g: making sure they are actually storing and protecting your data while you are interacting with their environment.<br>
- With personal computing devices, we stuck with single-factor authentication with your password. <br>
- Password History: Many organisation enforces policy that prevents you from using your previous password.<br>
- Complex password: utilizing capital letters, lower cases, numbers, symbols, and it should be relatively random.<br>
- Password Expiration: regularly changin your password helps minimise the risks of compromised credentials. Make sure update password whenever you feel it has been compromised.<br>
- Password Reuse: risky habit that can lead to domino affect if one of them is bridged. Definitely want to make sure you are using different password for your e-mail and banking.<br>
- Password Manager: stores and encrypts your password securely and can even generate complex passwords for you. e.g.: Lastpass, Keypass.<br>
- Password Privacy: never share your password with anyone, avoid writing them down or storing them on unsecured locations. If must share access, use temporary credentials, or authorised sharing platforms.<br>
- Secure Password Reset Process: ensures the reset request is legitimate, verify e-mail authenticity, and update immidiately if you suspect a bridge.<br>
- Change Default Passwords: always change default password as soon as possible. <br>
- Social Engineering: common tactic use by attackers to trick people into revealing confidential information or performing unsafe actions.<br>
      &emsp;1) Phishing: the most widespread form where attackers sent fake emails or messages for you to click the malicious link.<br>
      &emsp;2) Pretexting / Impersonating: someone pretending to be a trusted individual to get information.<br>
      &emsp;3) Baiting: offering something enticing in exchange for information.<br>
      &emsp;4) Tailgating: unauthorised person physically follows someone into a secure area.<br>
      &emsp;5) Dumpster Diving: attacker searches through discarded materials.<br>
      &emsp;6) Malicious or Compromised Content: beware of fake websites, infected downloads, and phishing links. Only use trusted sources.<br>
- Securing Devices:<br>
      &emsp;1) Anti-Malware Software: designs to keep malicious files off your machine. Ensure it is updated. <br>
      &emsp;2) Firewall Software: ensures you are protected from unauthorised accces to your network or devices. Ensure its updated and active. <br>
      &emsp;3) Authentication: use strong, unique passwords. Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA).<br>
      &emsp;4) Remove software that is unwanted, unnecessary, or malicious.<br>
- Spyware: gathers information about system usage, like websites you visits, or things you buy.<br>
- Keyloggers: reports the key structure you make, like credit card numbers, expiration date.<br>
- Ransomware: at a predetermined time, locks up the data. Some will encrypt the entire content of your harddrive, demanding money in exhange of access to your data. Usually piggybacks on infected zip files attached on emails.<br>
- Anti-Virus Programs: treat older application, both applications and definition files updated.<br>
- Steps to Recovering from Malware Attacks:<br>
      &emsp;1) Recognise the symptoms of an infected computer.<br>
      &emsp;2) Quarantine the computer as soon as you suspect something. Disconnect from any networks.<br>
      &emsp;3) Run anti-malware software to search and destroy any malware found on the systems.<br>
      &emsp;4) Remediate, restore any lost files or corrupted operating system files.<br>
      &emsp;5) Educate all users of the systems about the peril of clicking on unknown files.<br>
- Spoofing: a type of cybercrime where a criminal disguises their identity to trick someone into sharing personal information, money, or other sensitive data.<br>
- Piracy Websites: a website that illegally hosts and distributes copyrighted material, such as music, movies, software, or games. <br>
- A known site is usually a safe site.<br>
- HTTPS: Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure that encrypts the communication between a web browser and a website.<br>
- SSL and TLS: enables you to connect to a website or other internet server with some surity that the communication will not be crackable.<br>
- Negative Security: a security model that allows most traffic by default, and only blocks traffic that matches a list of known malicious behaviors. <br>
